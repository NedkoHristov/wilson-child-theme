# Wilson (or any other) wordpress child theme

Child theme is a theme that inherits functionality from another WordPress theme, often called parent theme.
Child themes are often used when you want to customize or tweak an existing WordPress theme without losing the ability to upgrade that theme.

On the Wiki page you can find how you can make super easy your own child theme, bulgarian version of the tutorial and other interesting stuff.
